                                                        Building the Cursive app was a learning process for me in many ways, both with the tools I learned to use and
                                                        very much with the design process.

                                                        <li>Establishing explicit goals and audiences for survey writing is important.  The general nature of my survey reflected my initial uncertainty with my project’s direction.  As a result, my survey results reflect an imprecision that might otherwise not have been there if I had sought follow-up feedback when my project direct became clearer to me.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>The law of proximity holds true.  Users form associations when objects and items are in close proximity to one another.  This was an issue I encountered time and again because I wasn’t adhering to a basic principle of design.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <li>Journal everything!  I regret not doing as good a job as possible with keeping notes about my process.  The practice of daily reflections on my projects is something I’ve gotten a lot better at.  But it would definitely have made my life a lot easier if I had followed this discipline starting on Day One.</li>

                                                        Despite all this, I’ve received lots of positive feedback regarding the overall direction and construction of my project.  For educators juggling a myriad of tasks, including grading, lesson planning and conferencing, having a system within which they can boost productivity without feeling as though the are “falling behind” is a boon.  A card system and something as simple as a Create and share button grouped together on the same app go a long way towards making their lives just a little bit easier.
